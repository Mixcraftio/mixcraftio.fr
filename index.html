                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m currently a student with a strong scientific background. I have completed two years of preparatory classes (MPSI â†’ PSI) at Jeanne d'Albret in Saint-Germain. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to understanding how things work, and especially tech related inventions. Ranging from low-level computer architecture to software ecosystems, my interest knows no bounds and I probably have already seen it all at least once.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-block">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">school</span>
                    <p>
                        I hold a <strong>BAC gÃ©nÃ©ral, mention trÃ¨s bien</strong>, <strong>Brevet des collÃ¨ges</strong>, and a <strong>Cambridge First Certificate (B1)</strong>. I also scored <strong>714 points</strong> on the Pix digital skills certification.

                <div class="about-block">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">memory</span>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy tinkering with electronics. I have made multiple arduino projects and often have disassembled electronics just to understand how they work. Tech as a whole really is a passion of mine always renewed by the advancments made in the industry.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-block">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">rocket_launch</span>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve built and launched multiple rockets for the <strong>C'Space</strong> event. These have helped me expand my knowledge in avionics, telemetry, and embedded systems programming. It reflects my interest in both software and hardware.
                    </p>

                <div class="about-block">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">code_blocks</span>
                    <p>
                        I value accessible and clean design in software: usability is just as important as functionality. I do believe that making technical tools approachable and intuitive helps better appreciate the technical marvel.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-block">

                    <p>
                        I have proficient knwoledge in programming and the way computers work as a whole. I have a solid understanding of both Windows and Linux internals, and Iâ€™m also comfortable with shell scripting. I have also dabbled in fields such as network config (NAT/PAT), self-hosting, and system internals through my projects.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-block">
                    <span class="material-symbols-outlined">explore</span>
                    <p>
                        I have worked with tools like Anaconda, Nginx, and Nextcloud. So Iâ€™m currently exploring new fields: I want to learn Rust for its safety and performance, possibly Kotlin for Android, and get deeper into reverse engineering. I also hope to work on bigger projects in the future.
